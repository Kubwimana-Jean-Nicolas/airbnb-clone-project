- `email`: User's email address (unique)
- `password`: Hashed password for authentication
- `role`: Indicates whether the user is a host or guest

**Relationships:**
- A user can **own multiple properties**
- A user can **create multiple bookings**
- A user can **write multiple reviews**

---

### 🏠 Properties
**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for each property
- `title`: Name of the listing
- `description`: Detailed information about the property
- `location`: Address or city of the property
- `host_id`: Foreign key linked to the user (host)

**Relationships:**
- A property is **owned by one user**
- A property can have **many bookings**
- A property can have **many reviews**

---

### 📅 Bookings
**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for each booking
- `user_id`: Foreign key linked to the user (guest)
- `property_id`: Foreign key linked to the booked property
- `check_in`: Date of check-in
- `check_out`: Date of check-out

**Relationships:**
- A booking is **made by one user** for **one property**
- A booking can be **linked to a payment**

---

### 💳 Payments
**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the payment
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linked to the booking
- `amount`: Total payment amount
- `status`: Status of the payment (e.g., paid, pending)
- `payment_date`: Date of transaction

**Relationships:**
- A payment is **linked to one booking**

---

### 📝 Reviews
**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for each review
- `user_id`: Foreign key of the user who posted the review
- `property_id`: Foreign key of the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numeric rating (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Text feedback about the property

**Relationships:**
- A review is **posted by one user**
- A review is **about one property**


## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This project includes several key features that replicate the core functionality of the Airbnb platform:

### 👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication is handled to ensure data protection and personalized experiences for guests and hosts.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. This feature enables the display of detailed property information, making it easier for guests to browse available accommodations.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables users to book available properties for specific dates. It manages check-in and check-out information and ensures that date conflicts are avoided through validations.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Processes user payments related to bookings. It records transaction details securely and ensures the financial flow between guests and hosts is properly handled.

### 📝 Review System
Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings after their stay. This helps maintain trust and transparency within the platform, benefiting both guests and hosts.

### 🚀 API Support (REST & GraphQL)
Exposes application data via REST and GraphQL APIs, enabling flexible integration with frontends or mobile applications. This also ensures clean, scalable communication between systems.

### ⚙️ Data Optimization
Uses indexing and caching strategies to enhance performance and reduce load on the database. This ensures faster response times for frequently accessed data and a smoother user experience.

## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of our API is essential for protecting user data, financial transactions, and maintaining trust in the platform. The following security measures will be implemented throughout the backend system:

### 🔑 Authentication
All API endpoints will require users to authenticate using secure methods such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources and perform actions like bookings or payments.

### 🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control will be enforced, distinguishing between guests, hosts, and admins. This prevents unauthorized actions, such as a guest modifying another user’s property or booking.

### 📈 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be applied to prevent abuse of the API (e.g., brute-force login attempts or spamming endpoints). This helps protect system resources and ensures fair usage for all users.

### 🔒 Secure Payment Handling
Payment data will be handled via secure payment gateways, and sensitive transaction information will never be stored directly on our servers. This minimizes the risk of financial data breaches.

### 📫 Data Encryption
All communication between clients and the server will be encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS), ensuring that user credentials and personal data are securely transmitted.

### 🧪 Input Validation and Error Handling
Strict input validation will be implemented to prevent injection attacks (like SQL or XSS). Errors will be handled gracefully to avoid leaking system information through responses.

Security is critical across all areas of this project—from user authentication to booking and payment handling—to ensure the platform is trustworthy, compliant, and resistant to threats.



## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. They help ensure that code changes are automatically validated and safely delivered to production without manual intervention.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is crucial for maintaining code quality, catching bugs early, speeding up the deployment process, and enabling collaborative development among team members.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing and deploying code with every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments by containerizing the application.
- **PostgreSQL Service**: Used in the pipeline to run integration tests against the real database engine.
- **Celery & Redis**: Integrated into the Docker setup for testing asynchronous tasks in the background.

The CI/CD pipeline will help maintain a reliable and scalable development lifecycle for the Airbnb Clone project.
